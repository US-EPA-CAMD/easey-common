/**
 * The decorators that depend on environment-based configuration (e.g., ApiExcludeControllerByEnv, ApiExcludeEndpointByEnv)
 * must reside in the backend API itself (such as easey-auth-api) rather than in easey-common. This is because calling
 * functions like getConfigValue('EASEY_AUTH_API_ENV', 'local-dev') at the time decorators are defined in easey-common occurs
 * too early (before the backendâ€™s configuration and dependency injection context are established)
 * leading to undefined values.

 * In contrast, decorators that do not rely on environment variables (e.g., BadRequestResponse, NotFoundResponse)
 * can be safely placed in easey-common. We can still centralize environment-dependent logic by putting functions
 * like shouldIncludeInSwaggerDoc in easey-common. This way, environment checks occur at runtime within the backend
 * API, ensuring that configuration is fully initialized and available at the time of evaluation.
