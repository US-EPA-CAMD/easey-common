The easey-common package contains shared code from across the US-EPA-CAMD project. 
 
# Downloading and using easey-common

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project package up and running and downloaded.

### Prerequisites
- Project running node
- A ```.yarnrc``` file existing in the root directory, with the contents of: ``` @us-epa-camd:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com ```
- [Authenticate to github package registry on local machine](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry)

### Installing
- Select desired version of package. The most up to date package version is [![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/US-EPA-CAMD%2Feasey-common.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/gh/US-EPA-CAMD%2Feasey-common) . <br>
- In terminal execute ```yarn add @us-epa-camd/easey-common``` for latest current version or ```yarn add @us-epa-camd/easey-common@VERSION``` to install a specific version

### Using
- Import desired files from folder within package.
- For example, to insert the logger: ``` import { Logger } from '@us-epa-camd/easey-common/logger'; ```

# Adding and publishing to easey-common

## Getting Started 
These instructions will show you how to edit the existing package, and publish a new version.

### Prerequisites
- Cloned easey-common github master branch on your local machine

### Adding directories
- Create a new folder in the ``` src ``` directory of the project
- Create the export files that you wish to add inside of this folder
- Create an ```index.ts``` file inside of the new folder
- Inside of the ```index.ts``` file, export all added files from the folder 
- For example, the ```index.ts``` of the logger modules is:
```
export { LoggerModule } from "./Logger.module";
export { Logger } from "./Logger.service";
```

### Adding files
- Create your file inside of the desired easey-common directory
- Within the ```index.ts``` file of that directory, export the exported members of the new file

## Publishing new package version
- On the current branch in terminal, add all file changes with ```git add .```
- Commit files using ``` yarn commit ``` which executes the [commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) plugin, a commit formatter that is digestible by [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/)
- Follow the prompts and create your commit
- Push the commit to your current branch
``` git push origin CURRENT_BRANCH```
- Github workflows for this package are set up to create new package versions whenever a push or merge to the ```N.B.x, N.x (N is a number), master, next, next-major, beta, or alpha``` branches is executed
- Semantic-Release will version all code automatically, based on the input received from the commitizen commit

## Maintenance Releases
[semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) supports releasing patches for previously released versions where it is not possible to fully upgrade to the more recent versions. This is accomplished using the `N.N.x and N.x` branch names where N is the version you want to release a patch. If it is required to release a patch to a previously released version then the following steps must be followed to properly release a new patch version.

1. Determine the version to be patched
2. Clone or pull latest from easey-common
3. Create `N.N.x` or `N.x` branch
   - If the version has subsequent versions after it
     - Create `N.N.x` branch with N being the major and minor version of the version being patched
     - Example using v1.0.0 to be patched and the v1.0.0 release tag
       - `git checkout -b 1.0.x v1.0.0`
   - If the version does NOT have subsequent versions after it
     - Create `N.x` branch with N being the major version of the version being patched
     - Example using v1.1.0 to be patched and the v1.1.0 release tag
       - `git checkout -b 1.x v1.1.0`
4. Implement changes in `N.N.x` or `N.x` branch and then follow the same steps above to commit changes using `yarn commit`
5. Release workflow will release a new patch version for the version you choose to be patched

# Testing `easey-common` changes locally 
Making changes to `easey-common` usually involves first testing those changes locally before pushing to remote and merging to `master`. To test these changes against a backend-api (e.g. `easey-camd-services`), you can use local path dependencies to link the local version of `easey-common` to the backend API. This allows you to test changes without pushing `easey-common` to the remote repository.

In the following instructions, we will use `easey-camd-services` as an example backend API to test local changes made to `easey-common`.

By using **local path dependencies**, you can directly link the local version of `easey-common` to `easey-camd-services`.

---

## Steps to Use Local Path Dependencies

### 1. Update Dependency in `easey-camd-services`
- Navigate to the `easey-camd-services` project directory.
- Open the `package.json` file.
- Replace the `easey-common` dependency with a local file path reference:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "easey-common": "file:../easey-common/lib"
}
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
- Run the following command in the `easey-camd-services` directory to install dependencies and link the local version of `easey-common`:

```bash
cd project/easey-camd-services
yarn install
```

### 3. Build `easey-common` Locally
- Navigate to the `easey-common` directory and rebuild the project whenever changes are made:

```bash
cd project/easey-common
yarn build
```

- The rebuilt changes in `easey-common` will immediately reflect in `easey-camd-services`.

### 4. Test Your Changes
- Do `yarn build` in `easey-camd-services` to build the project.
- Run and test `easey-camd-services` to verify the changes made in `easey-common`.

---

## Reverting to Remote Dependency
Once testing is complete and the changes in `easey-common` are finalized, revert the dependency in `easey-camd-services` to the version published in the remote repository:

1. Open `package.json` in `easey-camd-services` and replace the local file reference with the appropriate version number:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "easey-common": "x.x.x"
}
```

2. Run the following command to reinstall dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

---

## Notes
- Always ensure `easey-common` is rebuilt after making changes for the updates to reflect in `easey-camd-services`.
- If you encounter any issues with local path dependencies, try clearing the `node_modules` directory and reinstalling dependencies:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
yarn install
```

This workflow allows faster development and testing of changes in `easey-common` while integrating with backend APIs.
